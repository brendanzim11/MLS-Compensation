Python Prediction using different methods on what players should be paid, determine what part of a playerâ€™s stats are most important, and allow others to understand what they may be paid if they were in MLS.

Check the Major League Soccer Total Compensation Analysis.pdf for the write up on the project and my analysis on the outcomes.
The code is in the Final.ipynb which shows all the calculations that I had done along with how I created the visualizations.
